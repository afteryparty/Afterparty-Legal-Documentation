At **Afterparty Bots** ("we," "our," "us"), we value your privacy and are committed to being transparent about how we use cookies and similar technologies to collect information when you interact with our Bots (VERSA, Afterparty Groovy Music, Lofi Vibes, VoiceMaestro, Lava).

This Cookie Policy explains what cookies are, how we use them, and the choices you have regarding their use.

### **1. What Are Cookies?**

Cookies are small text files that are placed on your device when you visit a website or use an online service. These files help the service recognize your device and improve your experience by remembering your preferences, login details, and other settings.

### **2. Types of Cookies We Use**

We use the following types of cookies:

* **Essential Cookies**: These cookies are necessary for the functioning of our bots and allow you to access features such as music playback, role management, or moderation tools. Without these cookies, the Bots may not function properly.

* **Analytics Cookies**: We may use cookies from third-party services (such as Discord’s analytics features or other bot management tools) to collect data on how our Bots are used. This helps us improve our Bots’ functionality and performance.

* **Performance Cookies**: These cookies help us understand how the Bots are performing and allow us to monitor performance and troubleshoot issues.

### **3. How We Use Cookies**

We use cookies and similar technologies for the following purposes:

* **To Improve Functionality**: Cookies allow us to remember your preferences and settings so you don’t have to re-enter them each time you interact with the Bots.
* **To Monitor Performance**: Cookies provide insights into how users interact with our Bots, allowing us to optimize performance and ensure a better user experience.
* **To Analyze Usage**: We may use cookies to track user interactions and analyze trends in bot usage to better understand user needs and improve future updates.

### **4. Your Cookie Choices**

You have the right to choose whether or not to accept cookies. Most web browsers allow you to control cookie settings through their privacy preferences. You can disable cookies or set alerts to be notified when cookies are being used. However, please note that some features of the Bots may not function as intended if cookies are disabled.

For Discord-based Bots, cookie control can be managed in Discord’s own privacy settings.

### **5. Third-Party Cookies**

Our Bots may interact with third-party services, such as Discord or analytics providers, who may set cookies on your device. These third parties have their own privacy policies that govern their use of cookies. We do not have control over third-party cookies.

### **6. Changes to this Cookie Policy**

We may update this Cookie Policy from time to time to reflect changes in how we use cookies or for legal, operational, or technical reasons. Any significant changes will be posted in our official channels, including on our website or Discord server.
